# MyEnumerator
This code doesn't have any practical but educational purpose to get to understand how enumerators work, and also to propose what I think is a possible implementation. Obviously, real C implementation would be and surely is totally different. I wrote this code just to have an initial ruby project in which I can apply the concepts and practices I've been learning.

For a senior developer this can be considered basic and non elegant code. In any case comments and code improvement suggestions are absolutely welcome.
